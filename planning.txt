Primitives to use? 

- HMAC
- AEAD
- Signing
- Hashing 
- Symmetric keys
- Asymmetric Keys
- RSA (we'll see ab this one later oml)
- AES 
    - CBC: XOR with IV first, and then 
- one-time pad


There is no security measures on:

- fw_update
- fw_protect

Our plan:

Encryption:
plaintext
encrypt CBC (ciphertext)
generate HMAC
append to encryption
encrypt CTR (ciphertext + HMAC)
Caesar Cipher 26

Decryption:
Caesar Cipher 26
decrypt CTR (ciphertext + HMAC)
check HMAC
decrypt CBC (ciphertext)

Check version # (can't be an older version excluding 0)
