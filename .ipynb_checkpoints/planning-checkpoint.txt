Primitives to use? 

- HMAC
- AEAD
- Signing
- Hashing 
- Symmetric keys
- Asymmetric Keys
- RSA (video)
- AES 
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - CBC (a block cipher): XOR with IV first, and then encrypt
    
Must add security measures to:
=======
    - CBC: XOR with IV first, and then 
- one-time pad
- GCM ???

- fw_update 
- fw_protect

<<<<<<< HEAD
    
=======
Our plan:

Encryption:
encrypt CBC (ciphertext)
generate HMAC
append to encryption
encrypt CTR (ciphertext + HMAC)

Decryption:
decrypt CTR (ciphertext + HMAC)
check HMAC
decrypt CBC (ciphertext)

Check version # (can't be an older version excluding 0)
